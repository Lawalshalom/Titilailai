                <h3>Dr. Adebayo Kolade</h3>
                <h4>Ibadan, Nigeria</h4>
                <p>
                  <br/>When I joined SCM on Thursday Jan 18 (or 25, not sure) 1990, I did not even know I was joining a fellowship. I was a rather smallish boy from downtown who arrived late to resume. There was no money, so I did not make any attempt to seek accommodation.
                  <br/>I carried a free X-Ray from home, but when I found out that I needed to pay at Jaja, I sneaked out and carried my X-Ray around. I saw that I was posted to Kuti Hall, so I went to Kuti and roamed around. I was the only student from my secondary school who got admission into UI, and I only vaguely heard that 1 of our seniors ever got admitted to UI, so I had nobody to look for.
                  <br/>But my father always taught us that if we ever travelled away from home, we should find a temporary father where we went. The wooden block fascinated me. One old looking 100 Level student took me in (Room 29). As I roamed around, I found another old looking fresher who took interest in me. At first sight, I concluded that this should be a good school father. So, instead of staying in my Room 29, I spent most of my first 2 days in Room 40.
                  <br/>So, on Thursday evening, my new father took his Bible and said, Let’s go. I followed him. And I just continued following him like Mumu. The whole thing was strange that day; it was so un-Baptist!
                  <br/>And then, so many people were trying to shake my hand – kilode??!!! I still remember Bro Sola Ajibulu holding the mic that day. So I kept following my school father Sundays and Thursdays. One day, it was raining, and we hid under the Senate building.
                  <br/>He reminded me of a popular Yoruba song, and thus recommended that we should follow Jesus into the rain. He stepped forward, and I followed him. By the time we reached Chapel, we were drenched. I followed him so much that my Dad at home knew I had another dad in school called Tade Majaro.

                <h4>Connecticut, US</h4>
                <p>
                  While at GCI/QSI, the spiritu santus nature of some of my female Christian classmates used to put me off. They were never smiling, so I did not want anything to do with them. In June, just before my UI admission, I was cleaning my parents’ living room when I saw an old and worn book called the Lydia book of the Baptist. Flipping through to see if it was worth saving, I ended up reading the whole book, full of salvation message. I felt so broken and convinced. I read the sinners prayers and there gave my life to Christ. That was the beginning of my Christian Journey. I longed for more books like this that shows your dependency and sufficiency only in Christ. With the help of the Daily Bread and the Gideon’s Bible with the Anglican hymns, I tried to fill some of the vacuum. This hunger and thirst followed me to UI. The decision of which fellowship to settle down with – IVCU or SCM – was made easy because the spiritu santus were in IVCU. Also, my class schedule favored the Thursday fellowship. So I settled myself in SCM to meet some familiar faces and welcoming hands. Of course we were a smaller group, but you could almost physically touch LOVE. They lived and carried the love of God in their eyes, their voices and their choices. I resolved to love and shape my life like this. The likes of my Bros. Kolapo, Tenu Adeosun, Babatunde Okikiolu, Sis Bola Sofela were my classmates and and also in SCM. We were all pampered and loved by the older ones. The love was also very genuine and no ulterior motives. People would choose to visit me on their birthdays. And you better be prepared to encourage them with some scriptures. Bro Biodun Adeniyi in Transport spoilt me, and when Bruuche my cousin took over, you can imagine what the squad of him and Bro Kenny Akindemowo did for me & Idia Hall Sisters. Bro Dave Fadugba was like a bigger brother I never had. Bro Tosin Odunsi was one of those jimjim brothers you see like Father Christmas especially when he moved to UCH. Bro Charles with his tenses, grammar and accents was my president when I joined the fellowship and I think sis Toyin Adesokan was the Vice. Strong and don’t mess with her Her bible study class will make you want to read the whole bible. Bro Moses, our bible study sec was an encyclopedia of various editions of the Bible. He was always in his characteristics short sleeve shirt. Bro Bro Motunrayo was my follow up brother and you better be paying attention when he visit because he is very soft spoken. Those visit ensures that whatever you had for quiet time be ruminated upon because you can easily fall back to them during any follow up visit. Bro Biodun Olojo, was one President that checked upon us whenever we are having joint practice with IVCU choir during Easter/Festive season. Bro Victor Ola Akande and Bro Ebenezer babatope, I remember we decided to join grass root politics out when souls were perishing, it was simply joblessness. School was on strike but we learnt some core political moves. I remember I will write to encourage the new fellowship president during their swearing in. That always makes me pray for them too. I recall my days with chapel Sunday school held in the basement and on Palm Sunday we will have the best behave students ride the donkey to around Abadina with the rest of the students walking behind with their palm leaves sing Hossanah . The chapel days reminds me of the ushers most of them were SCMers in the usher’s robe and the likes of sis Nike and sister Iyeseun, in chapel choir as well as the pride I used to have with bro Niran Obasa at the piano, scm served with pride through bro Lekan Orenuga, sis Funmi Olukoju, sis Bola  Olusesi, my sis Omolade Adebayo. SCMers were very active in chapel. and friends like Bro Olumide Folalu, Bro Mike Ogundimbola, Bro Olumide Ajibawo, were as close as a glove. Free and relaxed with SCMers, I never needed to act in SCM. Choir was such a closely knit family, and we were special. The EDV with Bros Kenny Olatoye, Ayoola Aladeojebi, Niran Obasa – I’m going to get myself into trouble now because everyone in Choir was special to me. Oh! I can’t forget Sis Oyoma; classmate, choir and same hall. Sis Evelyn roommate – more than a sister. My All the “Rere ma ni o” popular choir song team. I remember I used to ride with Sister Iyabo Obasanjo in her Volkswagen Beetle back to the hall before I joined the exco. I remember how we shared everything. All exco had to accommodate as many sisters as your roommate will allow. As the former treasurer, the new treasurer had no accommodation so, sis Motunde has to be with me. Unfortunately my sister too got admission and no accommodation. Making 3 of us, then bro Lekan Orenuga came for a 2mins visit and brought a jambito from “Ilu oke” with him and as he was leaving he said sister Ronke, take care of her o. I ran after him what do you mean my roommate has her squatters and we are 3 already and it was a small D block in Queens hall. He stepped back and said, if she were to be a brother I won’t come here. I’m entrusting her into your care. When my sister came back to see that I have another person to share my corner with, she called my Daddy that she needs her own accommodation promptly because there was no end to how many people I will keep accommodating. But I bless God for that opportunity because my jambito of 1992 is a full professor today and assisted me in obtaining admissions for some of our kids on this platform. She is Prof.Simbo Apata nee Arowojolu.
                  <br/>I remember the Ilorin crusade where we were to go into the street to invite people. You have to consciously relegate your poise and “sarcadelicness” and speak in undiluted Yoruba language to the indigenes. Preached to them, led them to Christ and invited them for the crusade which was starting a few hours later that Friday. By the second day the news of the program had circulated well, courtesy those who attended the first day event. That was my first experience leading someone to Christ and I had two that day.<br/>I recall my experience on one of our trips to Ilorin when the bus landed in the bush and poison ivy dealt with us seriously. Another incident of ‘poise in the garbage’. What can you do when werepe starts dealing with you?! I remember I was affected the most.<br/>My story will not be complete if I don’t mention that on these trips, starting from the moment we left Chapel, I mean immediately after prayers, Bro Lawal would give me no peace. There had to be something I said or did not say. My school of thought had to be error-laden. We would argue from beginning till we got to our destination. I remember clearly one day the President Bro Debo had to warn us that he would stop the bus and send us back to UI if we didn’t stop. That got me thinking and I resolved not to assuage his argumentative poise. I promised to deal with him one on one, but he was very kind and brotherly when not in a crowd. Countless visits during those long breaks to each other’s houses.
                  <br/>I also recall the trip to Sis Joy & Bro Sam Okafor’s wedding. To begin with, Miracle (our bus) in her bid to demonstrate her name developed some drama, so we got to the event late and a lot was dependent on Hallelujah Choir because Bro Sam was our Papa. (He took care of us, visiting us like we were his biological children – that’s another story for another time; the Balewa experience with Bro Sam Okafor, Bro Obiora Ikeobi and Bro Frank Asieba). Anyway, we ministered during the reception at Onitsha. All Yoruba boys and girls singing Igbo songs “lai wo we” (off heart), your guess is as good as mine! Trust Bro Oby who was conducting the ministration (loving as anything but don’t mess with him when duty calls, and unfortunately he is a perfectionist); he had to tell me and a few others “Me cho nu”, meaning shut up. Sis Bukky Olojede was leading that song since majority of us had been “me cho nued”. So you kept dancing but you dared not sing those nonsense vocabularies that were making people laugh at us. I’m sure you wonder what songs those were.<br/>Ta bu bochi, Jehovah meworo-2ce
                  <br/>Nunia nonu nimeya<br/>Ti hallelujah nimeya<br/>Ta bu bochi, Jehovah meworo.<br/>The wordings are something like that.<br/>Thank God Papa Sam is forgiving and he enjoyed his special day. Since that day, I resolved to practice any song ministration well. Can you imagine us singing Igbo songs in Onitsha and messing it up? Ridiculous!!!<br/>I think my resolution then started earning results as I started taking solos and giving special numbers. And I recall one I took with my dear friend, My Tribute which made me take personal likeness in Andrea Crouch of blessed memory. Guest what? Guess who? I took duet with your Uncle Lawal o. It was beautiful, we learnt each other’s verses just in case one forgets his or her lines. It was no competition rather it was the wealth of message. Effortless and soulful. How shall I say thanks for the things that you’ve done for me.<br/>Things so undeserved yet You gave<br/>To prove Your love for me<br/>The voices of a million angels<br/>Could not express my gratitude
                  <br/>All that I am, and ever hope to be<br/>I owe it all to Thee<br/>I recall my political experiment in UI. Right in my 200L, I was the Faculty VP. I really didn’t receive support from brethren which I guess was for the fear of backsliding and knowing this I vouched that I would come out successfully; that brethren would even come for the Faculty dinner because it was going to be so comfortable to brethren (as in, no alcoholic drinks would be served, etc.). Well, I was a voice during my tenure, ensuring accountability and I recall an event when we went to offices/factories in Lagos, particularly Nigerian Breweries offered us Star & Gulder Larger beer, and I said we wanted just cash support or the softer drinks like Maltina as we were respectable University students. Guess what, the Marketing Manager practically walked me out. At the end of the day, I discovered that my exco team discovered why I wasn’t successful with some of my assignments except with Coca-Cola. They went behind me and apologized and got their promise of beer load for the FASSA night. I couldn’t even attend my FASSA week dinner talkless of inviting brethren. Why I share this is because of the important lesson I learned that a VP does not hold much power until the President is unavailable. With this realization and the need to secure accommodation for brethren I went for Idia Hall chairperson. When other brethren from other fellowships saw and supported my candidacy, my 3 opponents stepped down. So I became the only candidate for Chairperson. Unfortunately, on the eve of elections, I saw my results and they were not so encouraging. So I decided to not go again on the day of manifesto. Election came and I was voted for despite not showing up for the manifesto. I won but I did not take it up. In fact, I relocated to Queens Hall that year.
                  <br/>I recall those early morning evangelism trips for the drama, Escape. YouI can hear bro Okikiolu’s voice shouting Escape on those loud speakers as early as 5am. And this reminds me of Sis Enitan of blessed memory. Those were not any ordinary drama. SCM received a lift spiritually and numerically due to this event. And I’m glad the culture is now an SCM tradition. Kudos to all drama group members of that year. That event made us to be more spiritually ready and vigilant.
                  <br/>I recall our exco meeting that some people claim I made them wait till after midnight in Chapel. For what? I wonder! When grammatical grenades are thrown about incessantly!! In one statement Bro Debo would have coined three new words softly spoken and juxtaposed, leaving half of us in wonderment of what he meant.
                  <br/>I enjoyed love like no one else, SCM was home within a home for me. Another event I remember was the eve of my 21st birthday. I was just getting ready to go home, had been ill since morning and Sister Bola Olusesi asked me to come stay in her room and she would take me home in the evening. Suddenly I became nauseous and I vomited. Sister Bola asked me to go and clean my face first with water, and as I turned to do that she locked the door so that I didn’t have access to the room and she cleansed the emesis. If she didn’t I would have continued the act because I could not see it and not start another round. But I’ve been eternally grateful to that little saint and big but humble Sister Bola that showed me that when you love someone, you can clean up after them. She did not mind my dirtying her room. She took care of me and took care of the job. Thank you Sis Bola, you may not know how much you mean to me but you mean the world to me.
                  <br/>I have to stop before I get myself into trouble because I have good history with almost everybody. Let’s wrap it up with kudos to the likes of Sisters Iyabo Duduyemi, Foluke Awotoye, Lade Ayeni, etc., who taught me how to make “moimoi elewe” whenever we had Awareness. Those fellowships that we moved around one another’s house during those ASUU strikes; those lovely brethren visits I received at home – I cannot forget.
                  <br/>I recall when SCM National was 50 and I was to be one of the ushers for the WSCF delegates but unfortunately their flight was delayed so they came late. I kept asking that I had to go home but the venue we used did not have commercial rides and it was on outskirts of the town at that time, so I had to wait for the National President to take me and others after he must have attended to the arriving delegates from outside the country. By the time he was ready, I was crying because I knew you don’t disobey my mum. You just don’t come home in the dark. It was not the time of cell phones. She would have waited endlessly at the shop and gone home out of fear, about 10-11pm. The way I was so afraid made him not drop others whose houses were on the way but he rushed to drop me home. We got home and fearfully I approached our gate. The whole street was dark (no light) but the generator was on so I knew my mum had not slept. I shook the gate and when my mum answered she told me to go back to where I was coming from. I told her it was a fellowship program but all my explanations fell on deaf ears. Mr Adegbolagun then spoke up appealing to her and she was furious asking him if he had children and if his daughters come home at 10pm after leaving the house since 8am. She would not open the gate and everyone in the car asked me to follow them back but I stayed, and a while after they left, she came to open the gate. Since then, I haven’t seen my poor National President to apologize for the insult.<br/>I had the good, the bad and the ugly, in UI. What built resilience in me and prepared me like no other for the larger world was that I had extra years in UI, not one semester, not 2 semesters, not 3 semesters but 4 semesters because the class that I had problem with was a second semester class which I didn’t know I had problems with until the end of my 3rd year. This experience rendered my graduating grade to a pass. This gave me the experience and platform for a conscious and independent spiritual growth. I had the proverbial Israelite journey in life and I was made stronger for it. Ran a postgraduate course in OSU, became a Chartered Accountant, became CISA certified and came back for a Masters program in UI in 2004 before leaving the country and finding greater fulfillment in the medical field.
                  <br/>I seriously did not want to settle down with anybody in SCM but the pull was too strong. . So yes, I settled with one quiet brother in the Choir. ??

            <h3>Pastor Lawal Lanipekun</h3>
            <h4>Lagos, Nigeria</h4>
            <p>  <strong>MY SCM STORY…</strong>
                <br/>I used to be known and addresed as Lawal Lanipekun-Reeves until I got married an my wife and I took the decision to drop all our non-African names and now my names are Adojutelegan Majiya Lanipekun-Lawal.My first encounter with Christianity was  as a junior High school student in December 1979. The UPN government in the South-West then had introduced the free education programme and with it came the opportunity for me to own a free Bible. It was at the invitation of a ‘crush’, that I joined the SU Movement in the school.<br/>However, I was like the proverbial seed that fell on the rock. It got withered because there was no root hold for it. I went radically back to Islam, the religion into which I was born and raised.
                <br/>Whilst studying for my ‘A’ Levels at the Federal School of Arts and Science, Ondo (FSASON), I re-committed my heart to Jesus Christ and by November of the same year I resumed as a freshman in Sociology Department of the University of Ibadan.
                <br/>My first time at the Chapel of the Resurrection was  November 1987. That day was the last Sunday of the joint fellowship between SCM and IVCU, as a result of the suspension of religious activities on the UI campus during Babangida era. This was in response to the counsel we were given to immediately join a Christian Fellowship preferably a CU/ Nifes immediately we resumed in our various higher institutions of learning.<br/>The Chapel that day was full and the fellowship beautiful, the worship in particular was wonderful.<br/>At the end of the service, the announcement was made for new members  to either join the  Wednesday or the Thursday Bible study group. I decided to join the Thursday group and needless to say that I was terribly disappointed when I did not see the Sunday crowd on Thursday and the music was ‘one kind’. However the fellowship was rich and people smiled genuinely. I sat besides a Sister who I later knew to be Yinka Ajomale. She prayed and worshipped as if she was listening to a different kind of music than what I was hearing.
                <br/>Bro Charles Adeyanju preached that night and I could still picture him in my mind in his greyish-blue blazer on black trousers, I really could not remember the topic of his message ,but I could still recall  a line from his teaching “… I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren… ” I later found that quote to be from Romans… That was the impact of the message on me that night .
                <br/>On getting to my room in E60 Zik Hall(wooden), I expressed my disappointment with regards to the attendance to one of my Christian room mates who advised that I could check out the Wednesday group. Just before I could do that, I received a visitor in the person of Brother Chika Okoroafor with whom I was upfront with my disappointment and many other questions about the fellowship. He calmly advised that I made a repeat visit on Sunday evening and when I did, the hall was still scantily filled and the music still ‘bad’, but this time around I felt I should stop complaining and instead lend myself to service in whatever ways  I could. When the call was made for people to join the choir, I registered myself with Sister Bukky Dipeolu and that night several freshers like Kolapo Oluseye, Muyiwa Ajakaiye, Ayo Ogunremi, Victor Ola-Akande, Olumide Fatokun, Agnes Bayode, Nike Adesogan, Ronke Adebayo, Sola Ajiboso, Dayo Ogunleye and many more joined. KTO who became my closest friend,  was the unofficial assistant to Sister Bukky until he later served  as the substantive leader of the Halleluyah choir.<br/>One of the days Bro Chika came visiting again and this time with Bro Sola Ajibulu who was introduced to me as the Zik Hall rep. On my first day of fellowship in his 2nd floor ‘C’ Block room, I was called on to be the Evangelism coordinator for the hall.
                <br/>Bible studies were rich and deep, Sister Iyabo Duduyemi whom we nicknamed ‘My Radical Sister’ was my first teacher, her class was inclusive and lively. Bro Moses Olayemi as the Bible syudy secretary was a wonder with the scriptures. I looked forward to his ’rounding up’, cladded in his short sleeve shirt and pencil trousers, most times with  sandals to match.
                <br/>I took my assignment as Zik Hall Evangelism coordinator seriously, and I intended to make a success of it. But this was cut short. One Thursday evening towards the end of first semester in my 100 levels. Bro Charles began to announce the names of the new Excos to take over from his team. I was excitedly clapping for my friends whose names were somehow desrvedly called. Tenu Adeosun(Prayer), Okikiolu Babatunde(Evangelism), Yemi Ogunrin(Tedder HR), Lekan Orenuga(Bello HR), Bolanle Olusesi, Funmi Olukoju, Allwell  Ibeagha, Biodun Adeniyi  Morgan Nwoko and some of the names earlier mentioned in the choir.  Bro Chika Okoroafor who was announced as our president was a year one Diploma student of Library studies in the Faculty of Education. It was in the midst of thede that I heard my name.There must be another Lawal Lanipekun-Reeves, I thought. When my name was announced the third time,  Bro Tenu nudged me and said ” Brother, e dide” meaning,  “wouldn’t you stand up, Brother ?”<br/>I got up with my knees knocking at each other, and sweating all over. No one consulted with me, and nothing prepared me for the shock.
                <br/>Even though, the others were freshers like me, they had integrated so well. Majority of the science students had been involved with PSSF which Tenu Adeosun coordinated. Just Allwell,  Agnes, Biodun,  Morgan, Bro Chika and myself were in the Humanities. I believe this was the beginning of growth and stability journey of SCM, UI.<br/>It was a large Exco, and other people who served  in that team who were however not freshers include but not limited to  Brothers and Sisters  Biodun Olojo, Tope Agesin, Debo Saba, Susan Ahaemefule, Lade Ayeni, Seun Adesogan, Sola Ajibulu, Foluke (VP) and many more.<br/>My first assignment was in the Twin office of Librarian/Colprteur. Library, I understood but who or what is a “Call Porter ? ” I had never heard the word before, neither did I even know how to spell it . Eventually, I found out that a Colprteur is merchandiser of books and other materials. This ]department enhanced my growth and balanced view because apart from reading all the books in the library at the time, I had the responsibility to read materials that would be recommended for the pbrethren. In spite of the fact that the department operated without any budgetary provisions, we grew and at a time I had to  recriut Augustina Bubu,(Prof Onome Davies) to assist me.
                <br/>My first career job, was as a salesman and merchandiser with the Leventis group. SCM gave my first cognate career experience. My other line of business now is still merchandising.
                <br/>I later took over from Bro Sola Ajibulu and served a term as the Zik Hall Rep. It was there during this period that I met and developed solid friendship with Tope Dosumu. We were room mates with Deji and Tola Tade. The four of us are  pastors of  growing and thriving churches  today ,to the glory of God. SCM was my first seminary.<br/>My last assignment in SCM leadership was as the Publicity and Publication Unit leader.
                <br/>I was actually called out and prayed for as the Fellowship PRO. That was how my predecessors in office,  Bro Morgan and Bro Dave Fadugba operated. I saw the weight of the assignment on them,  and I thought we should rebrand to meet the current realities and challenges of publicizing SCM at that time. We divided the assignment into two Publicity and creative writing (Publication). I had a hot headed creative,  Gbolahan Saba as a protégé. He would first fight me and everyone else before coming out with great outdoor concepts and designs. Kolade Adebayo used to call himself a ” bush boy ”  yet spoke and wrote better English than any city man I know. I used to wonder, what he was doing in Vet medicine. Tokunbo Owoseje, Fadekemi Oyewusi, Bunmi Afolayan, Bibilola Fatoki, Busola Omole, Tope Obaweya, Toyin Falode, Jabez Akindipe were some of the great people who made job easy.
                <br/>My second career is in the Media and Marketing Communications. PPU sowed the seed of creativity into me, for which I’m forever grateful.<br/>Everywhere I looked, I see the hand of God through SCM in my life. SCM introduced me to leadership. Our exco meetings in those days were very robust and boisterous, especially when Bro Debo spoke those his English which we didn’t understand, and stubborn Deronke would  decide not to yield grounds and keep us at Chapel basement till 2:00am. Now, when church workers and ministers act ungovernable, I remember how I stressed my presidents, especially  Bros  Sola and Debo in particular.<br/>I learnt how to prayerfully plan programmes and raise money for projects.
                <br/>There were different flavors of leadership. For Bro Chika, every meeting was deliverance, Bro Biodun almost turned all of us to Anglican priests. When Bro Sola went to Deeper Life ‘we went with him’ and all of us were saying,  “… in Jeeesus naaame… ” like Pastor Kumuyi. It was a potpourri of leadership grace and I am the better for it.
                <br/>Our conferences and
                <br/>mission trips to Enugu, Port-Harcourt, Benin, Ile-Ife, Jos, Ilorin etc were my first time in some of those places.<br/>I particularly enjoyed those fellowship time during holidays when only a few of us would meet and thereafter go visiting brethren in their homes. I was also visited.<br/>I remember our small parties ,love feasts a b day picnics .
                <br/>I didn’t know how much of the word l had in me and the grace to teach it until I went for the youth service where I was made the Bible stud secretary.
                <br/>I learnt stage crafts through my membership of the Deliverance Theater group. I wrote the play that was staged when my sister and friend, Enitan Ayansoga passed on. Yinka Fasoba had passed on a year before and we were all sad.<br/>Of all my getting from SCM, however,  I didn’t get a wife. Actually  some of my friends made serious efforts at teaching  me on how to “recieve a sister”, I guess I wasn’t spiritual enough.<br/>Well, God gave me a wonderful woman for a wife. We got married at Chapel of the Ressurection in the presence of many of my SCM family. She got the ‘ feel’ and now she’s an  SCMer by conversion. Head or tail SCM won.
                <br/>This in a nutshell is my SCM STORY, if I have the opportunity,  I will do it again and again.
                <br/>O God Bless our Movement SCM… !

            My SCM Story
              <br/>I was admitted to UI in 1997 to study Vet Medicine, so I had in mind to study hard and enjoy myself being my first time away from home.
              <br/>I come from a solid bible-believing background under the tutelage of an IVCU alumnus and most of my church folks were in IVCU. I decided to avoid IVCU but I wanted a well grounded fellowship, not some jamboree centre with delinquent teenagers. I hope I dont sound too serious because I’m really not an outwardly serious person but I believe God is serious about us.
              <br/>A friend and I was strolling pass Chapel that Thursday night and I heard this beautiful worship (led by Mercy) which I couldn’t resist. I came in and realized it was end of fellowship, so I just sneaked out again. I was back the following Thursday and was in Bro Kadiri’s bible study class which was so in-depth and then the following week Bro Kolade. Bro Kunle Kasumu was the Gen Sec I think and he was quite inspirational.
              <br/>My squeaking in and out continued for over a year, until one Thursday that Tomiwa caught me as I was about to sneak out as usual and invited me to join the choir. By the way, I am a worship leader and that was why I didnt want to go to IVCU. I was the music director of our youth church choir from home and I wanted to come to UI to read. I was trying to hide but I couldnt do it for too long. I joined Halleluyah choir and that was when the beauty of God’s gift made a way for me. I enjoyed all our Jabulanis, praise concerts, choir ministrations and even fellowship worship time.
              <br/>I remember Bro Pec (Peculiar) once told me he used to record any worship session I led for his personal worship time. SCM gave me a bigger avenue to touch heaven with my worship. I have literarily seen heaven open during worship before. Worship still remains an integral part of my life, I live to worship God and lead people to God’s presence. Serving in the exco as SEFLO is another part and this opened up the world of alumni to me. I had to relate with very old people and even people that met me in school and left because I was in UI for 6years.
              <br/>I remember asking them if they were sure God told them I was to be in the exco because I knew I would radicalize the norm. I didnt believe in those long exco meetings, calling Bro and Sista this and that but disrespectful, among other unduly sanctimonious norms. I remember a family meeting where I said if calling me Sister, then a 600L student and exco member, was going to hinder our friendship drop the sister and call me my name. I was more interested in having Godly and truthful friends. SCM has blessed me with friends, family and especially a Godly mentor and father, Prof Saba.
              <br/>This is my SCM story.

            My SCM Story
              <br/>I gained admission to UI to study Veterinary Medicine in the year 1990. I came from a church background which encouraged me to join a Bible believing fellowship as soon as I got to school.
              <br/>I stayed in Independence hall room A1 in my first year. I was invited to SCM one Thursday evening by Bro Soji Ademuyiwa who also was in 100L with me at the time. He was visiting his course mate who happened to be my ‘landlord’ at the time. My ‘landlord’ was already attached to a Fellowship: that was my first week in UI. I moved to campus a bit later than my mates. I recall being visited by Sis Tundun.
              <br/>In my 200L, I was appointed Mellamby Hall repwhen I took over from Bro Tunji Shobayo. It was a great time to grow spiritually walking and working with the brethren. We had many sessions of fasting and retreats at ICS in which there was no food, no water: only air. That was the slogan.
              <br/>I remember I was an SCM Usher most of my stay in UI. I served with many AGS’s: Sis Toyin Omope, Sis Tope Obaweya, Sis Bola Morohundiya, Sis Adeola (now Obasa)… can’t recall any other. I was usually situated in the central isle of the chapel.
              <br/>Was also involved in Follow up group: I loved visiting and I still do. I still wonder why I never got involved with school visitation.
              <br/>In my final year, I got into a relationship with Miss Iyabo Abiri, a fellow SCMer, Veterinary student and a fellow SCM Usher….
              <br/>As they say, the rest is history

            My SCM Story
            <br/>Good day beloved,  the story of my Christian journey is incomplete  without SCM UI where the seed of my salvation was watered, nourished and ever since has been growing. My encounter with the fellowship  started around this time 29 yrs ago when I got admission to UI. At the admission office area some brethren gave me a  handbill (not printed but hand written ) inviting me for a fellowship, some days later, on getting to my allocated room in idia hall, I was welcomed by a lovely Sister full of smiles in person of sis Tundun Ogunbanwo nee Fasina. She was very nice,  she was just like a big sister always ready to give a helping hand,  so automatically, when she invited me for a fellowship I couldn’t say no & when I asked her the name of the fellowship lo & behold it was the same with the handbill scm.
            <br/>The fellowship was full of life; it was as if all the brethren were taught how to smile and welcome people. Though they were not much, no musical instrument but you could feel the love,  feel at home with the brethren & also feel the presence of God. SCM UI was home away from home.
            <br/>How i loved to join the choir then but i have a very wonderful voice, knowing  that if i sing the whole fellowship will fall under the anointing of laughter. Hmm, drawing i can’t draw, so I ‘jejely’ joined the prayer band. Thank God I did, it wasn’t a mistake.
            <br/>Many wonderful memories;  is it the 3 days retreat no water, no food during moG leadership…. I thought I would pass out, sisters’ programs, weddings outside Ibadan, genuine  display of love, exposition of the word( which really helped me to have a foundation that am building on today) and many more beautiful time i had in scm ui.
            <br/>Married to a scmer?
            <br/>No. God bless our movement SCM…..

              I was introduced to SCM during my HSC days at Ilesa Grammar School, Ilesa but I wasn’t really serious with it then. When I got to UI in 1985, there was a vigorous evangelism going on then. I had read in one of the novels (Pacesetters series) about October rush when you get admitted into the University, my own rush came from Bro Sam Okafor Udah. I agreed after he prayed with me and decided to join the fellowship when I eventually moved into the campus (I was coming from the town then). By the time I got a bed space to share, I landed in room D12 Indy hall. By divine providence Bro Charles Adeyanju and Bro Biodun Ogunbanwo now Oluwabamiwo were already in the room. Both were in SCM. It was the time a fellowship that broke away from SCM under the leadership of the then President was making waves in the campus. They made overtures to many Jambites then and a friend wanted me to follow him. But I got hooked to SCM from my first day in SCM. With my co-roommates it was not long before I became grounded in SCM UI.
              <br/>Bible study was getting interesting, Sunday fellowship became difficult to miss. Going home during holidays was difficult for some of us because we do missed ourselves so much.
              <br/>By the time the exco were sent off, I became exco member. I started with being the Publicity Secretary. All we do then was buying cardboard and tempo. I will on foot round the campus pasting the posters handwritten by an inexperienced Dave but with encouragement from Bro Charles who always appreciated whatever I designed. Together with aggressive evangelism, a focused and dedicated executive under Bro Tosin, numbers increased. On my part some of the brethren we knew in our HSC days were caught for SCM UI. I was virtually in all the subgroups. Drama, Halleluyah Choir, Technical unit, every job is for every available brethren then. We worked as if we were in UI for Evangelism. Never tired of heeding the call for fellowship activities even at the risk of our academic pursuit.
              <br/>I didn’t end up with an SCMer o though they were there but with another sister who finished in another campus faraway some years after I left school. Ise Oluwa ni.
              <br/>SCM gave me my identity. I am an SCMer (UI) through and through.

              I had shared a part of this story at the outset of this platform.
              <br/>I started my Christianity as a member of FCS (Fellowship of Christian Students) in my secondary school.
              <br/>In my first few weeks in UI I joined IVCU in 1985.It was my first fellowship.
              <br/>One Sunday evening, in our Prefab Wooden Block in Kuti Hall where I had to squat for my first year in the University. Bro Taiwo Phillips my next door neighbor stood up as we talked one Sunday evening and announced he was going to fellowship. I wondered what other fellowship existed on campus then. I said, I would follow him.
              <br/>I got to the fellowship, I met about twenty to thirty people (at most then). I had never, I think even till now, seen anyone beat drum sets like bro Femi Orekoya with so much energy and passion. There was no keyboard (I guess the more reason why the drumming had to be exciting),
              <br/>It was a departure from where I was coming from ;IVCU. Yet, some thing else stood out for me that day. The warmth, exuberance and the palpable fellowship I received from the brethren.
              <br/>All the members came to shake my hands. You can guess who they were :bros Sam, Udah-Dan,  Charles, Moses Tunji Adesemowo. Tosin Odunsi, Sisters Biodun Adegboye, Bukky nee Dipeolu, Constance, Iyabo (Duduyemi) “Moji (Bamtefa) , Sis Toyin nee Adesokan with her mouth wide disarming smile (never knew we were in same course of study at the time) and others my mind can not immediately grasp now.
              <br/>That was the last time I went to IVCU. They responded with a vigorous follow up after but I was able to survive it.
              <br/>SCM has continued to be the pivotal experience of my life ever since.

              My SCM Story
              <br/>I am Oluwakemi Osunberu (nee Ero-Phillips). Course Vet. Med. Hall: Idia
              <br/>Subgroup: Evangelism/Follow-up
              <br/>Duration of Stay: 1989/1990 to 1997 (Courtesy: ASUU Strikes)
              <br/>I joined SCM in January 1990 as a Christian from Secondary School. I attended the fellowship on my 1st Sunday in UI, thinking SCM was IVCU. I settled for SCM because I realised that in SCM I would not be lost in crowd.
              <br/>I immediately joined the evangelism/ follow-up group where I served  throughout.
              <br/>Initially, I was a triangle student that is Lecture-Hostel- Fellowship.
              <br/>I served as a Floor Rep in India Hall and as the Vice President SCM, Oyo/Osun sector from 1992-1994.(I can’t really remember now). This exposed me to SCM beyond UI as I had to visit institutions like OAU,  CINDICO, LAUTECH etc.
              <br/>SCM helped to shape my political future, I was sponsored for a West African leadership training outside Nigeria by SCM.
              <br/>I served on SCM national committees: National Electoral Committee (2ce) and the National Constitutional Committee. Such assignments were very challenging in those days.(you should have seen brethren in action during national elections..).
              <br/>I was also opportuned to serve on Electoral Committee of SCM UI (2ce or so) and SCM UI Constitution Committee.
              <br/>I enjoyed SCM, my friends and I used to call ourselves the 6 o’clock Christians.
              <br/>My Journey into UI Politics
              <br/>I decided to break my Triangular life style in my 3rd year as a Veterinary Medical Student, I wanted to contest for the post of Gen Sec Idia Hall. I sought counsel from the SCM UI elders but I was advised against that. I had to wait until my 5th year when the elders finally permitted me to contest for the post of Chairperson of Idia Hall. I won the election overwhelmingly with the support of SCM Sisters in Idia Hall. I will never forget this phase of my life. SCMers are wonderful brethren. They supported me, always around me. They made my tenure a huge success without compromising my faith. I never backslided. I will remain thankful to Sisters Susan, Buki, Ogooluwa, Toyin Falode, Dupe Orogun….too numerous to mention… they were my political partners. I appreciate Br. Tade (the president at the time) & all the supportive SCM Brothers.
              <br/>I also served as a member of the Students Representative Council of UI Student Union Govt.
              <br/>I thank God for directing me to SCM, keeping me and crowning me with SCM like brother Husband.
              <br/>I still enjoy SCM benefits across the globe. A big ‘thank you’ Pastors Tope & Dayo Dosumu.

              My SCM Sttory
              <br/>My SCM Journey ran concurrently from Secondary School to SCM UI.I started fellowshipping with SCM UI in 1988 with my senior sister Fadekemi Oyewusi and was handed over to sis. Busola, Sis. Bibi and bro. Dele Odeniyi when she finished UI.
              <br/>I witnessed different generations of SCM exco and I think I may be the only one that knows many generations of SCM generals from 1988 to 1996 or 1997. Bro Tade, Bro Debo Saba, Bro Wale Eniade, Bro. Ayo Ademuwa,  Bro Dosumu, Sis Toyin nee Adesokan, Sis, Nike Adesogan, Bro Lawal, Bro Muryiwa Ajakaiye, Bro Isaac Taiwo, Sis Motunde nee Yekini, Sis Ronke Adedimeji,  Sis Kemi Babajide, Kayode Bankole, Sis Tolu, Sis. Morenike
              <br/>I met many brethren and God used them to make me who I am today both spiritually and physically, I was totally blessed in all relationship I had and still have today through SCM UI.
              <br/>God used me to assist in getting the school visitation team to access my secondary school at Bodija and some other schools. Looking back to those years, they were solid years of my Christian faith, as God was equipping me. I had few challenges in Secondary school cos I was an exco in fellowship and also the school’s social prefect…what a combination! It was tough satisfying God and man…but my big brothers (Bro Yinka Ayeyemi & co)  from school visitation team were there to advice my confused young mind.
              <br/>I enjoyed the retreats and musical concerts organised by SCM secondary schools then and I was invited to  other schools to speak in their programs. I also also took students to attend GCI/QSI camp and SU easter retreats. All this happened as a teenager to the Glory of God.
              <br/>I learnt how to make MoinMoin using leaves in one of the sisters week and that is one thing I will not forget about SCM UI. Also, I enjoyed travelling for brethren wedding such as sis. Dayo, Bro Tope and sis Tolu’s wedding.
              <br/>Sometimes, attending fellowship alone was not easy for me as we lived at the end of the campus Phillipson Rd and Kurumi Rd (different years). Especially as my sister was in Queen’s Hall & after she graduated. When the bus or buses are not working, I felt that was the end of coming as my parents does not like the late night fellowship. But walking with bro Wunmi Adesina, sis. Moji nee Bamtafe (who stayed in our BQ then), sis. Bunmi nee Aina and bro Segun Afolabi made it easy (Philipson Rd)
              <br/>I will also be forever grateful to the transport team. However, when we moved to Kurumi Rd UI, Bro. Tayo Omobowale, Bro.  Niran Obasa, Bro Tosin Awosanmi, Bro Damola Daini and some other brethren would escort me home. Without them my fellowship with SCM would have stopped.
              <br/>I joined the organising team and I was well fulfilled with the kind of leadership exhibited by  Bro. Chris and being the only lady there was no discrimination.
              <br/>I was partially a member of Halleluyah choir during school breaks and anytime the need arose I stepped in to minister in programs like the Biennial conference in Jos.
              <br/>I thanked God for the foundation I had in SCM, the people I met and the relationship that I built through SCM UI.

              My SCM Story
              <br/>My SCM journey started in my final year at a “girls” secondary school when a young man who had a sibling in my class came from OAU to do his teaching practice. I had always thought that this classmate of mine, Dupe had something special about her but the glow around her brother (name forgotten) was palpable, it was Jesus. He started a fellowship and as a Baptist, it made sense, so I went along. Our Principal was concerned that this “Jesus thing” was an unnecessary distraction and banned the fellowship but the seed had been sown.
              <br/>I gave my life to Christ in my local church just before resuming for my “A” levels. On the first day, an acquaintance invited me to the school fellowship. It happened to be a SCM fellowship. There I met the beautiful Morenike Adetunji and we became God lovers. We went to every seminar, revival programme and yours truly gave her life to Christ on many occasions until understanding came.
              <br/>Our Teachers were SCM alumni and would always invite those who were already on Campus to our event during Uni breaks. I remember seeing @Dave Fadugba on one of those occasions.
              <br/>UI – 1987/88 to 1991/92
              <br/>It was a natural thing for me to join SCMUI when I eventually
              <br/>secured an accommodation in Idia Hall common room. I was taken aback by the size of the fellowship compared to my sixth form, it was relatively tiny. It made no difference, I felt at home and joined hallelujah choir. My induction to screaming hallelujah at the top of my voice, I still do now.
              <br/>Lots of learning and shaking at this stage, I remember being completely shocked when I was asked to borrow a white shirt to complete my uniform, I had not been to boarding school or faced with this level of sharing. I refused to sing/minister. Let’s just say that by the time the Holy Spirit finished with me, I could have a whole outfit that no one in my biological family would recognise – all acquired (Pun intended). Sis Korede Adeola who left UI for OAU did help my understanding too.<br/>I was a reserved person and particularly enjoyed my own company but brethren would not leave me alone.<br/>My life in Idia hall had a layout:<br/>@ Omolade Olowe/Bukola Olojede if I fancy a good time<br/>@ Funmi Ajibulu/Bola Sofela – good time annex B<br/>@ Aderonke Adedimeji for cold water<br/>@ Egin Foluke Okunyade was probably the only source of my peanuts and other snacks<br/>@Ogbuefi Evelyn if I fancy a genuine chat about Jesus and my supply of music ministration with or without request<br/>@Tundun for a never ending pot of concortion – that sis can perform some magic with a few cups of rice and sparse condiments- chilli pepper, de rica and maggi cubes.<br/>Life was beautiful in spite of some of the challenges that ensued – leadership issues, a few brethren resitting their exams and dealing with grief.<br/>I had to deal with grief, as far as I can remember, for the first time with the passing of Sis Enitan. I asked questions, pondered a lot and it strengthened my christian walk.<br/>I chose to stay in Queen’s hall in my final year (500L) for various reasons and so glad that I did. The vibe was different to Idia hall’s but the love for the Lord no less.<br/>Serving as a Cell leader, Bible study teacher, Idia hall rep and later as Vice President were all great opportunities to fellowship, observe and grow. They were all part of the foundation and the growing that is continuing.<br/>My diplomacy was “wonderful”, I remember telling a sister who went to see a secular show at Trenchard Hall that I was disappointed in her as firmly as you could imagine. There were many cringe-worthy moments as I look back but I learnt from them all. At SCM, I learnt to follow, I learnt to lead and I learnt to be friendly.<br/>So I continued to serve God – true true! – and our then President, Olumuyiwa Ajakaiye, that I served with as VP came to my room on the day I was finally leaving UI and declared his manifesto. We got married in 1995.<br/>SCM Alumna
              <br/>Bizzarely, I don’t miss you because you are with me in my spirit at all times even before social media. We shared so much that many of you never fail to turn up in my thoughts then I briefly long for you. I am intrigued to observe through our comments on this platform, how much we share in common, how we have been shaped by our life encounters but what rings true for me is that Jesus Christ still takes the first place.

              My SCM Story
              <br/>We (myself, Brother Tenu Adeosun and Brother Okikiolu Babatunde) gained admission to UI from Government College Ibadan after our Upper 6, but we all came as Prelim Student.
              <br/>Before now, the 3 of us got born again while in GCI, and started the GCI/QSI Christian Fellowship.
              <br/>This fellowship was pioneered by 5 of us. It was the training ground we needed before coming to UI.<br/>God is d that fellowship to prepare many young and fresh Christian for Ministry. The exploits and testimonies s will be for another day.<br/>Immediately I came into campus, brothers Okiki and Tenu were already on Campus. ( I came in Kate because I was to change from Medicine to Physiotherapy, but some how I forget to write a letter requesting for a change of Course at the College of Medicine, so the change was not effected despite the fact that I was 22 marks above the cut off mark to study Physiotherapy. Eventually, I opted for Chemistry after meeting with our then HOD Prof Adesogan.<br/>On getting to UI, brother Okiki told me about a small fellowship that they attended, and he will like me to check it out. We then went to I think Independence Hall, Bro Charles Adeyanju’s room to visit him. There and then, the choir were having their rehearsal. I saw a key board, but no one was playing. I just knew in my spirit that I will not only join the fellowship, but I will be active in the choir.<br/>Within 3-5 minutes in their midst, the holy spirit told me about what he is about to do in UI through SCM. He also the role HE will have me play. It was an awesome experience.<br/>The warm welcome of  Brother Charles, and I think Brother Motunrayo as well as Sister Bukky was so contagious, and from the start I felt at home.<br/>That was how I joined SCM UI, and this was the Genesis of my great time at the University.<br/>Brother Charles, Brother Dave Fadugba, Brother Moses Olayemi, Brother Motunrayo, Sister Bukky Dipeolu Brother Idowu Olojede, Sis Toyin Adesokan, Sis Susan Amaefule, Sis Iyabo Duduyemi, Sis Seun Adesogan, Sis Bukky Adegboye, Bro Tope Agesin, Bro Sam, Brother Obi Ikeobi, Biodun Olojo,  etc. These were the prominent lovely brothers and Sisters I met in the fellowship.<br/>My set ushered in new set of brethren; passionate and loving.  Many of them, we served together at one time or the other for which I am most grateful to;<br/>The Roll Call:<br/>Brother Lawal Lanipekun Reeves, Brothers Tenu, Okiki, Morgan, Bola Adedimeji, Kehinde Olatoye, Muyiwa Ajakaiye, Ayo Ogunremi, Sola Ajibulu, etc<br/>Sisters Ronke Adebayo, Sola Ajiboso, Nike Adesogan, Bola Olusesi, Funmi Olukoju, Tundun Fasina, Dayo, Femi, etc.<br/>SCM made UI worth attending for me.<br/>I will also want to state that we demonstrated the sincere love of God amongst us. The way we visit and care for one another almost attracted even Executive Members of other fellowships to join us.<br/>I will want to specially appreciate our able Presidents between 87-91;
              <br/>Brother Charles Adeyanju, Brother Biodun Olojo, Bro Chika Okoroafor, Bro Dola Ajibulu and Brother Debo Saba.
              <br/>I also appreciates Hallelujah Choir Leaders;
              <br/>Sister Bukky Dipeolu, and Sister Evelyn Okocha (whom I handed over to).
              <br/>The Hallelujah Choir Members are simply amazing.

              My SCM Story
              <br/>I was born in a Muslim home but was caught up in an  encounter while in secondary school.  Couldn’t attend any fellowship then outside school hours because either my Dad or Mom would be  waiting to pick me home immediately after school hours.
              <br/>During my A’Level classes at ISI,  Late Mrs Aransiola, can’t remember what she taught then usually encourage us to  make sure we  get hooked to a fellowship once we gain admission. On getting to UI,  my Dad informed the Muslim society that his daughter was on campus,  so they pursued me and I kept running.
              <br/>I was moving from one church and fellowship to the other on campus asking for the leading of the Holy Spirit to know where he want me to be. I even attend IVCU once I think but was not fulfilled. Some how I came to chapel area one Sunday and I saw this small group.
              <br/>I joined the fellowship,  was blessed and knew this is the place for me.  That fellowship was SCM.  I used to be very shy,  so shy that I can’t look at people straight in the eyes,  so that kept me  glued to the seat and didn’t serve in the fellowship. Also was being careful of the Muslim brethren,  because they really pursued me to  get me back.
              <br/>I wanted to serve,  so I observe carefully all the units / departments to see the one that will suit a shy sister.  I settled for publicity since no one will know me in fellowship , am just  involved in making posters and cards which was a natural talent with me.  I make sure I am not involved in the pasting of the posters so no one will know I did them.  Haaa,  thank God for Wura.
              <br/>In my final year,  when I had less work load ( we all know Pharmacy wahala)  My able room mate,  friend,  confidant and sister was on my neck. The able Sister Bukky.  I love songs and sing a lot,  she encouraged me and make sure I joined the choir.  Then one day the Drama leader (can’t remember who again)  also picked me up on discovering the talents I had been hiding .
              <br/>By the time I was graduating,  I had gained some confidence and my shyness was on its way out of my life.  During my Internship and service in Kwara state I located the SCM secretariat and fellowship with the Senior friends . I thank  God for  my stay in  SCM and the life impact I got there. I thank God for the ministry HE gave birth to  in me.  Thank you.  I hope I was able to write a story..

              My SCM Story
             <br/>My story is more like a testimony.  I had issue with my admission letter. I did not get it at home and I had to travel 6 hours from ONITSHA to Ibadan.
             <br/>I did not know anybody and I came alone. I only had a letter from my secondary school chemistry teacher to stay with one of his cousins in UI to help me out. There were no GSM then and few land lines. I did not know if I will meet the man but I came all the same hoping for the best. God helped me and I met the man and we found out that I scored 15 marks below the cut of mark for jamb for computer science.
             <br/>The obvious choice was to change course or resit JAMB. I was not willing to do jamb again and he tried to get me into another Department.  It did not work out. I was frustrated.  My cash was running low. Matriculation was around the corner. I tried to get into university of ife as a second choice  but no show.
             <br/>With my return  cash spent and little left remaining I did not know what next to do. My days was spent going around the admission office hoping something will happen. One of those day after trekking in the hot afternoon two brethren from SCM met me and I shared my sorrows with them. I recall one of them  was the evang. Leader of excos serving under the tall bro Muyiwa MOG. I threw an open challenge to them. If you guys can do anything for me to get my admission letter by Friday,  I will join your fellowship.
             <br/>That day was Wednesday.  They did what they knew. They suggested we should do agreement prayer there at the corridor in the midst of all the noise.  I had been a  Christian much earlier in secondary school. So I understood their suggestion and we held hands and they prayed and we all left.  On Friday I came expecting the letter. I just took courage and was going in and out of all the offices there hoping something will happen. In one that I entered I saw a queue and each person was  were going thru A big folder and checking from first page to the last.
             <br/>I drew near and watched the event as nothing else to do and suddenly I saw a paper with  my senior sister hand writing.  I recalled she helped me to fill my jamb form. I screamed pointing at the folder and I was told to join the queue for my turn. With excitement and trepidation, I waited and when it was my turn, the had written note turned out to be my jamb form and a photo copy of my admission letter. Wow. I shouted again. Everything stood still. I was too thrilled for words. One of the clerk there stamped on it and asked me to proceed to my Dept and faculty to commence the admission process.
             <br/>I did not know if it was real or I was dreaming. So I went to my Dept and my name was on the list. Also on the faculty my name was there also! That was how I came into the fellowship and the rest as they say is history. Amen.
             <br/>Thank God for the brethren who took courage to pray and believe with me.

              My SCM Story
              <br/>Around the time Bro Lekan Oyewande was to be made the Bible Study Secretary he invited me to his fellowship for that evening.I did not go. I was a member of a fellowship that belonged to a church which I joined from home. This was in 1991.Bro Lekan and I were in the same class in the same department. We became friends much earlier and liked me so much for his own reasons!
              <br/>After some time, I decided to attend his fellowship once. It was cool in the evening but the brethren were quite very friendly and warm. I  liked it because it was pleasantly different from what I was used to : stern-looking brethren, everyone minding his own business. Naturally I wanted to come again. For my background, which was easily noticed, I was asked to join Basic Bible Class. Later, after a year, I switched to the Prayer Band.
              <br/>Towards our final months,the National President of SCM, Bro Israel Marioghae visited the fellowship and talked about Travelling Secretaries. This led me to go and questions from our fellowship President, bro Tade Majaro. He explained to me  and we left it at that. At the Orientation Camp in Kaduna in 1994,I did not waste time at all before signing in to be a Traveling Secretary. My reason?
              <br/>I WANTED TO SPEND ONE YEAR AS THE TITHE OF MY SCHOOL YEARS !
              <br/>I later became a Zonal TS and National TS.
              <br/>Brethren, it seems to me now that quite contrary to my childhood ambition to be an egg-head, my foray into SCM TS became my divine initiation into lifelong work in the Lord ‘s Vineyard .
              <br/>Succintly put, Bro Lekan Oyewande invited me into the ministry!

              My SCM Story
              <br/>Contrary to the experience many others told about their salvation experience, I had “gradually warmed up” to the Gospel before giving my life on the 13th May, 1993.
              <br/>I received my first invitation to attend a fellowship on campus (SCM), during my second year. I had been invited by brother Kenny Akindemowo. He was persistent and strategic. Interestingly, he was the twin brother of the boyfriend I had back then on campus.
              <br/>I admired his consistency at visiting me and his constant reminder that I owe him an attendance or visit at the fellowship.
              <br/>So, after much persistence and persuasion, I finally decided to honour the invitation for once. Music and dance was a great attraction to me I must confess.  “So, it wouldn’t be that bad.” I had thought within me. So I opted to attend on a Sunday.<br/>On this fateful Sunday evening, this brother was already waiting about 30minutes before fellowship at the porter’s lodge of my hall of residence. Either because he thought I would change my mind about attending or because he felt it was a duty he owed me, I cannot tell. I was however impressed that he came to pick me up; so, we left for fellowship.<br/>The meeting kicked off about 10minutes after we arrived. The atmosphere was just “charged”, for lack of words to describe the ambience I felt within the chapel that evening. There was something magical about the environment. I could see orderliness and a sense of purpose , there were ushers at the entrance welcoming everyone with a smile.<br/>As I watched many others arrive, I noticed the manner of greetings. They were so chaste, respectful, smiling and honoured one another. Their mode of dressing also caught my attention. Most of the brothers had funny looking trousers and that the sisters had scarves, berets or some form of covering on their heads with very few exceptions like me.<br/>I wasn’t disappointed with the praise and worship, I thoroughly enjoyed the singing and more especially, dancing! I had a swell time and once we sat down, I slept for about three quarter of the rest of the meeting. Whether the ushers made any attempt at waking me or not, I cannot tell. All I remember was that I enjoyed myself during the dance session but had not the faintest clue of anything else thereafter.<br/>I was invited again and again, and repeatedly, this slumber would take over once we sat down. And then came this fateful fellowship meeting, it was on Sunday night fellowship; a Pastor  Jegede was invited to minister. His words must have gotten through to me as sleep evaded me this time around.<br/>For once, I heard part of the message, got convicted and as he made the altar call, I knew I had to respond. However, I held back and refused to step forward as he invited.<br/>You see, that ‘SU’ where the ladies cover their heads, didn’t  wear trousers or use make-up wasn’t just for me. I found the mode of dressing a bit archaic, too simple and rather inconvenient. I just would never be ready to live that kind of constrained and boring life. I thought to myself, this just isn’t me. However, something kept drawing me to attend again and again.<br/>That fateful night of May 13th, 1993, the Spirit of God visited me with such strong conviction. The voice in my heart had asked why I was resisting His move in my life and with great contrition in my heart, tears welled up from within and I cried out.   I had an indelible visitation that looked like seeing  Jesus Christ with his pierced hands. I just couldn’t struggle anymore as I saw it all differently for once and felt so wretched and unworthy.<br/>With such feeling of guilt and unworthiness, I asked Jesus to forgive and wash me of all my sins and that I wanted Him as my Lord and Saviour. I shed tears all night but then His peace flooded my heart.<br/>You see, mine wasn’t just a case of confession and acceptance. I was remorseful and was truly sorrowful for many days as I realized I had lived in sin and just wasn’t worthy of His mercy and love. I could tell thereafter that I was a changed person.<br/>Hymns and songs from then on began to make meaning to me and the lyrics ushered emotions that brought tears regularly as I contemplated the works of my Redeemer for me.<br/>In no distant time, people started noticing the change in me. Some confronted me about the changes and I explained I was now born again.<br/>Before my salvation experience, the mind set I had was that this way of life in Christ was for the poverty stricken. At least that was the picture the enemy painted in my heart. He had succeeded in blindfolding me with such misconception for very long.  The god of this world sure blinds minds of men 2 Corinthians 4:4 (KJV)<br/>As my presence became frequent at the fellowship meetings, I started receiving visits from brethren especially sisters from my hall of residence. Three things I was quick to observe about these sisters was the joy that oozed from within them, what aura of peace they had!  The love and hand of fellowship they extended to me as well as hope expressed in all their conversations couldn’t go unnoticed. They were so positive! I couldn’t resist that love for long. Indeed, love conquers all.<br/>Let me also confess that as a young convert then, there were days I never wanted to receive these sisters’ visitations. I had often hidden behind the door once I recognise their voice at the door. My room mates would then cover up for me that I was not around. Why I did that, I sincerely can’t tell or remember. Maybe the flesh just was still dominant over the Spirit.<br/>I must at this point mention that some of those sisters too were not so friendly as they didn’t approve of my mode of dressing. So I had more friends in fellowships like VCF, S& P but for some reason, I just couldn’t leave SCM as I had this constraint within me.
              <br/>As I became more committed, I joined the evangelism team under bro Tunji Sobayo and later bro Remi Fadunmade. Cant forget our outreaches to Abadina then.  I had little knowledge of scriptures but was armed with my personal encounter and that zeal.
              <br/>Thereafter, Bro Fisayo Adeyemi (of blessed memories) invited me to join the bible study teaching group. I learnt the place of communion and that of service distinctively. Key to my stability in the fellowship were brethren like bro Lekan Oyewande who ministered the Holy Ghost baptism to me; Sis Taiwo Oyerinde was my bible study teacher for a while.  Sis Bola Moroundiya , Bisi James were great confidants  and friends from day 1, they made me feel comfortable in my own skin. Bro Deji Kadri and Bro Bisi were ever trieless in their visits both on campus and at home. I always marvelled back then at how bro Bayo Kolade knew ‘so  much’ when he was the bible study secretary and I often wondered if he was human. Bro Fisayo Adeyemi who has gone ahead of us remains a great pillar for my growth.
              <br/>Amongst the many trips we made during those days, the one to city of God, Warri for the prayer conference under evangelist Oguazi Onyemobi birthed something in me that I can’t forget in a hurry.
              <br/>Those early morning prayer meetings at the chapel, Idia hall and the early morning cries remain ever fresh and I would do anything to relive those days again. Thank you Sisters Bola Moroundiya, Lola Ayeni, Bisi James & Grace Babalola for always passing by to wake me up for those meetings. Your labour sure weren’t in vain.
              <br/>Just as it was back then, I just need to sing the lyrics of the song ‘Come Oh Lord and fill my heart, Lord I’ve come to seek your face, I want to know the ways of your glory, come Oh Lord and fill my heart. At this song, I get refired every time
              <br/>SCM made me recognise that voice within and till date, that voice hasn’t been scarce, just as it was almost 25 years ago. O God Lord bless our movement SCM!

              My SCM Story
              <br/>I entered UI specifically January 15, 1990 for medicine and surgery. Then, I was not clear yet which fellowship to join. But an interdenominational fellowship would be a good one. We had something like that in GCI (Govt College, Ibadan) where I had my A levels. There was a fellowship there coordinated by Mr Oladele. I still remember wonderful brothers like Okiki Tunde, Sola Oladeji etc. I was in Indy hall that year. At a point, I started receiving fellowship invitations from SCM through bro Lekan Oyewande and Deeper life.
              <br/>I was attending the two till I could no longer cope. I needed to choose one. Really,I was at a cross road. The determining factors were not the fellowships but those inviting me. Bro Lekan Oyewande never persuaded me. He simply related with me. He came down to my level in all respects.
              <br/>Fellowship itself was quite lively. The warm reception of the ushers was great. Choir always dazzling. I still remember sis Evelyn. The fellowship presidents bro Debo Saba,Bro Muyiwa Ajakaye, bro Tade Majaro were all charming. I can not forget these secretaries in a hurry-bro Kolapo and Bisi Afolayan. There was never any dull moments in the praise worship. I was under the tutelage of bro Tope Agesin  in Bible study while bro Stephen Babajide was in charge of prayer.
              <br/>I must come home with my own unit PPU-Publicity Publication Unit. Our leader then was bro Lawal Lanipekun Reeves. A wonderful leader in the real sense of it. I came across bro Adebayo Kolade in the group. I was inspired by the fact that he was already an author at that tender age. All the members of the group were notable personalities. Bro Gbolahan Saba,bro Soji Afolayan, bro Muyiwa, Sis Bibilola Fatoki, Sis Tokunbo Owoseje etc. Though my stay with SCM was short, the impacts on my life remain ever relevant.
              <br/>I am happy to observe via ” I de  Kampe” that every individual I know in this forum is moving up. Permit me to mention drama where bro Tenu held sway. The death of Sis Enitan still remains painful. But our comfort was that she slept in the Lord. Our collective prayer is that we all make heaven at last in Jesus name. Nice knowing you. Great to belong here.

            <br/>Brethren, maybe we should all recount how our SCM journey started.<br/>We should each tell <strong>MY SCM STORY</strong>.
            <br/>Let me tell mine.
            <br/>When I got to UI 1993/94 Set (I came as a Christian), I naturally joined the student fellowship of my (then) church which was pastored by my cousin.<br/>I was there for a whole semester (plus the period of strike). I was forcing myself to stay there more out of denominational affiliation and family loyalty.
            <br/>I wasn’t enjoying myself and I think I wasn’t growing spiritually. We were too emphatic on high sounding _pentecostalics_ Besides, I got born again in Fellowship of Christian Students (FCS) in the Northeast of Nigeria and did not really have traditional bond to denominations (my family background was non-Christian).<br/>When I could take it no more, I just said let me go and see these people calling themselves ‘Saints Called to be Militants’.
            <br/>I went there and I enjoyed the meeting thoroughly. There was something that got rekindled in me right from Day 1.
            <br/>Then they sent someone after me to follow me up: a sister, my mate by level.<br/>She came to my room in Indy Hall that I shared with my late friend, Femi Amerin. It happened that we had food stuff, we had electric stove but no electricity that day. We were hungry but had no money. We couldn’t offer her anything.
            <br/>She did the follow up and then when she was done, she gave us money (I think N10 or so) from her own pocket.
            <br/>We wanted turning it down but she insisted that we should accept it. We took it ‘reluctantly’ but delightedly. It fed us both at Mammy Market and we also bought kerosene with which we cooked.<br/>Femi later joined the Fellowship too.
            <br/>That sister later became an EXCO member, same as I. We later became friends. She later married another EXCO member and I was glad to attend their wedding.<br/>Many years later, the couple and their children were our guests in our house in Kaduna. (I also married an SCMer with whom I served in the EXCO).
            <br/>So, SCM gave me more than a lifetime experience, it gave me a lifetime partner as well.<br/>That’s my SCM story.
             <br/>God bless our movement SCM………

              <br/>My SCM UI Story
              <br/>Mine may not be as spectacular as a few as I have been privileged to read, sovour and relish with some deep sense of nostalgia on this platform, but I’d start from somewhere. I’d like to deeply express my profound appreciation to our ever amiable Sister Ronke and Bro Bisi (who actually contacted me and brought me on this platform). I got the admission into UI Computer Science Dept. during the 1991/92 academic session.  I recall joining SCM sometime in 1992. It was Sister Seyi Olufiade (my class/course mate) that invited me.
              <br/>Before then I had a few stints with Deeper Life and NFCS (Nigeria Fellowship of Catholic Students). During my 100level I had about 11 or 13 roommates in Zik Hall (where I stayed throughout my stay in UI) and they were 97% Deeper Lifers so after a bit of consistent persuasions I followed them to fellowship a few times but I couldn’t just fit in. However, prior to my visits to deeper life campus fellowship UI, I was born and raised in the Catholic church. I was the most senior mass server at my local church before I got into UI. Well entrenched in catholicism. I grew up as a devout Catholic obeying the 10 commandments with godly piety.
              <br/>My salvation story was at Sword of the Spirit Church headed by Bishop Francis Wale Oke. He actually led me to Christ. And I have been serving the Lord since then. One of my friends invited me to the church on a certain Sunday morning, 9th February 1992. Afterwards I went back to Catholic church but deep inside me there was a void that needed to be filled. I started having more questions than answers in almost everything I saw in the church and that’s where my search for the liberating truth began.
              <br/>I figured there was more in God. Hence I obliged my Deeper Life roommates by attending their fellowship a few times before I was eventually invited to SCM. I think it was a Thursday and I was wowed by the songs from the Choir and the message. I thought to myself, this is it. And that’s how it all began. My voracious hunger for the knowledge of the Word of God was driving me to study several books, attend programs, etc. It was as though I needed to catch up with something.
              <br/>I felt I had “wasted” too much time ignoring the Bible. I vividly remember my blue little King James Bible. I read that Bible like I had an exam; marked every “markable”. In my second year I joined my Departmental politics and became the President of our the department (Nigeria Association of Computer Science Students -NACOSS). That was huge and demanding with all the attendant challenges inherited from past leaderships as I had to schedule my time to accommodate all I needed to do in Fellowship, studies and the department. And by God’s grace we were able to set the standard and raise the dike. Back to my SCM story, I joined the Prayer Band unit.
              <br/>It was always a delight to pray. I was quite close to Bro Kayode Bankole as one of his executives. An amazing brother. He was my last leader (Prayer coordinator) in prayer band. I remember one Bro Chijioke too of prayer band. I always kept an eye on him during our prayer meetings. I wouldn’t want to divulge the reason though. He was a wonderful brother. I am particularly grateful to him for introducing me to some wonderful books that helped me tremendously; books on prayer by E. M Bounds, R.A Torrey, C. G. Finney’s Prevailing Prayers, etc. Our prayer band was really quite a unique blend of divers sorts and an epitome of our heterogeneity in terms of upbringing. I’m thankful for the privileged opportunity graciously granted me by Bro Kolade to serve as one of the Bible Study Class Teachers. It really helped me look into the details of the lessons/scriptures as we always needed to be ready before the Bible study. I remember those exciting times during Bible Studies on Thursdays. It was as though we were literally feasting on the Word. The excellence exuded in the production of the outlines was phenomenal. It was painstakingly done week in week out. Many thanks to Bro Kolade once again for that. He was almost always at the press to produce copies of the Bible Study outlines. Several years later I was doing the same (producing study outlines for different categories of leaders) for my local church spanning over a decade. Definitely can’t forget our several trips out of town like the Prayer Conference at Okigwe (presumably in 1994), several retreats at the RCCG Redemption Camp, etc. I can’t forget those 5am early morning prayers. If you got there 5minutes past 5am you felt like a “sinner” as the arena was already jammed with brethren. The periodic praying and fasting, mass evangelism, etc. It was always a joy to participate in these spiritual activities/exercises. So after UI we hit the ground running as we participated in our local churches because of the well-rounded preparations.
              <br/>My appreciation to Bro Deji Kadiri for the opportunity granted me to Coordinate the Final Year brethren of my set (1997) as the male coordinator and many thanks to Sister Lola who was the female coordinator. Our very Senior Friend Bro Eyitayo (hope I’m not missing the name) actually made a huge impact on us during this time together with Bro Lekan Oyewande and Bro Stephen Babajide.
              <br/>Like Katheryn Kuhlman said she’d tell Jesus, “I tried.” So in my conclusion, I want to say that I tried. I tried to do the best I could under the circumstances. My profound thanks to Bro Lekan Oyewande who was and still is a major inspiration to me. And Bro Stephen Babajide our President; these are pillars of SCM UI.
              <br/>Retrospectively, my time in SCM UI was quite eventful and full of pleasant memories. I could go on and on with specific details but for time and space, it is expedient that I draw the curtain at this point.
              <br/>I am eternally grateful to God and for the huge investments everyone has made in my life. Apologies if I have omitted a few other names. Those mentioned herein are the few that readily came to mind at the time of writing.

              <br/>My SCM UI Story
              <br/>The story of my life as a Christian and SCMer actually began in university of Ibadan in 1987. Not really sure of the date now. I remembered when I wrote my jamb I became very apprehensive of the result because I was not able to complete the maths exam. I became troubled not sure if I would spend more years of post wasc at home having already wasted five years at home. One night I was praying and asking God to intervene concerning the outcome of the result exam, a thought came to me “why don’t you vow to God you will Serve Him wholeheartedly when you get admitted to UI”.
              <br/>I came from Catholic background cum traditional so I understood what that thought was talking about. In my former secondary school I’ve had encounter with some boys whom we called SU. We used to pity them because they lived a total life of seclusion from everything in this life. It was so serious then that all they do was read Bible pray preach and fellowship as if that was the only thing about life. Many of them could hardly concentrate on their studies. So I don’t want to have anything to do with such people nor their group. Moreover I have a girlfriend I don’t want to loose then. So when God was telling me to vow I was aware of the kind of life He was calling me into in university. But I didn’t have choice I must get admission that year. I have wasted five years in Lagos trying to get a good job with my ‘O’ level result but all was a .mirage as it was one casual job to another until I decided to go back to school.
              <br/>So I told God I will serve Him wholeheartedly and that settled it and my peace returned. When the jamb result eventually came out it wasn’t a surprise I passed because it was already God’s battle. Though I didn’t know God intimately then but I was afraid how I would fulfil my own side of the game. So new session starts and I resumed as a new student of the great UI, but shortly before  then my father died  and this devastated me terribly. The only man that I could trust for provisions had died. This made me more afraid as the circumstances that lead to his death was shrewd in mystery. I took courage and resumes with other jambito as we.were proudly called then. In ui as a Jambite I was divided between many opinions. Should I give my life completely to God or live my normal life. I was also attracted to kegites then because as a village boy palm wine was our soft and hard drinks so my eyes was on this exuberant group. I remembered I had already collected their forms so I can join them but yet to fill and submit it. As if God was watching me and was trying to play fast number on me before I got lost in the crowd of ui community. I remembered after one “Dugbe” course one evening I saw a course mate going out and called out on me to let’s go to fellowship. Where is the fellowship holding–/chapel of resurrection. Oh that’s quite too far more so I was tired and needed to rest. But this friend of mine persuaded me that it won’t be long before we finish and promised to be a great time. So I followed him and that was the beginning of my journey In Christ. I gave my life to Christ there and then and I used the occasion to redeem my vow so I plunged myself into active service of the Lord. I didn’t know how to pray so I first registered my presence in prayer band got babtised in the Holy Ghost under the leadership of Bro Charles Adeyanju as the president of the fellowship. Fellowship was something to look forward to then, the .moment one fellowship ends you began to anticipate another one. No complain of spending too much time even if the fellowship stop by 1am. However it was a bitter pill to our Senior brethrens in the town We all love it, prophecy that followed deep praise and worship was a great consolation to our heart and we were never afraid. It was a normal thing to see people getting healed and delivered from demonic oppression.I remembered  the fear I broght to school following the mysterious demise of my father which almost paralysed me fizzled out in His presence and I was giving a heart of a lion. I later join organising subgroup because then the brother used to carry the Instruments on their head to Philistine road In bro Bola’sroom. He was the fellowship keyboardist then. So I joined this group to relieve this wonderful brother who was doing the work as if he was receiving salary from it. Sometimes we may not get to our room until 1:30-200am. But we were doing it wholeheartedly without complain. Mine was to try to pay my vow for my admission…serve me wholeheartedly was the bargain. God has taken me above all barriers of advancing in my academic carrier and being the first to break such a record among my brothers and siblings  of over twenty of us. No wonder the devil took my father thinking there won’t be any forging ahead after the demise of my father. But God is faithful,… when your father and mother forsake you the Lord will take you up. And He was truthful to His word. My five years in ui witnessed this faithfulness to His word. His provision was always there to meet any need at anytime anyhow. Glory be to His name!!!
              <br/>Permit me to say that I had some challenges of doctrinal differences from Deeper life school fellowship. As I was very naïve young convert eager to grow . I attended one of their fellowship and then hell was let loose. They kept bombarding me bringing many trivial issues ranging from hair btaiding , perming, shirt wearing of our sisters and that I need to come out from among them. They almost succeeded in winning me so I starts following them. But then SCM brethren were not taking no for an answer. The fish they’d caught must not be let go like that…is a sacrilege to allow that.
              <br/>Thanks to Bro SOLA Ajibulu and Sis Sola Ajiboso and some others who gave me a close marking and won me over completely. But that wasn’t just possible until they armed me with some powerful scriptures to neutralise the venom of their frivolous and superfluous doctrines. Then after I had peace and conviction to serve my Lord Jesus. Doctrine is one thing we should be ware as it could easily swept us off our feet.
              <br/>I later join evangelism team because of my passion for soul winning. I was made the organising secretary twice then evangelism secretary In my final year. I later handover to bro segun OGUNKANMI.  Serving as an Exco .member was something else especially with bro Muyiwa Ajakaiye. His vision was to get a coaster bus for the fellowship, get new instruments and ensure the fellowship increased in number. This vision we all Imbibed and pursued vigorously until all was realised within a short time Many a times some of us will travel to Lagos to see our senior friends to solicit for bus fund.
              <br/>I remember a day bro.LEKAN and I went.to.Lagos on this purpose. We just boarded a cab going to Ikeja from agege when someone close the door of the car on my finger that was hanging on the body of the car outside, imagine the sudden pain shout and cry, I thought all my fingers were gone. But when I came round and saw the five fingers were still on my hand even though I’ve to bear with the pain for dome days I was so.happy and gave glory to God. Emmanuel college of Theology was our hide out, our secret place  for prayer and fasting. Sometimes three days and night of continued fellowship and praising God. There was true holy love among us and no wonder the fellowship exploded during this time.
              <br/>Some of the things that helped us was the fact that we first gave our heart to Christ and so it wasn’t’ a difficult thing to give our body, pocket money and time to serve the Lord. We do disagree to agree but no one seeks his own interest but the interest of Christ and the brethren in general.
              <br/>Although some us nearly lost focus as we didn’t properly balance the equation of fellowshipping and our primary assignments in ui our academic carriers…some few of us had carry over in our courses just because we lost focus. But God  compensated us generally.
              <br/>About the time of rounding up our five years program In Animal Science the Spirit of the Lord began to move. It was moving me in another crucial direction of life. Really I wasn’t prepare for this…but the one that I’ve entrusted my life into his care said it’s time to do this. Mind you I broke up with every unholy alliances of both men and women girl or boy  so as to please my Master and Lover Jesus. I didn’t hold anything back from Him. So it was time for Him to lead me to fulfil this scripture “ …he that finds a wife find a good thing and obtains favour from the lord…..
              <br/>To be continued..
